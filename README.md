## Microservices Overview

| Folder                             | Description                                                                |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `api-gateway`                      | Central gateway that routes all incoming requests to respective services.  |
| `authentication-client`            | Handles user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication.            |
| `eureka-server-application`        | Main Eureka server for service registration and discovery.                 |
| `eureka-client-messenger`          | Manages private messaging between users.                                   |
| `eureka-file-store`                | Uploads and retrieves media files using AWS S3.                            |
| `eureka-friends-followers-service` | Follows/unfollows and friend request logic.                                |
| `news-feed-service`                | Builds personalized news feeds from followed users.                        |
| `post-service`                     | Handles posts, comments, and post metadata.                                |
| `rating-service`                   | Calculates user popularity based on interactions.                          |
| `search-history`                   | Stores and retrieves user search queries.                                  |

All services communicate through **REST APIs**, **Kafka**, and are registered via **Eureka**.

## How to Run the Project
---
```bash


### 1. Configure Environment Variables

- Copy `.env example` â†’ `.env`
- Copy `.config/common.properties.example` â†’ `.config/common.properties`
- Fill out the required fields (DB access, Kafka ports, AWS keys, etc.)
```
> ðŸ’¡ Need help setting up MySQL, Redis, Kafka, generating JWT, or configuring AWS S3?  
> Check out the [Dev Setup Guide](./dev-setup-guide.md) for step-by-step instructions.
```

### 2. Build the Services


chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh

This will compile and prepare all Docker images for each microservice.

### 3. Start Everything

docker-compose up

All services will launch automatically and be accessible via API Gateway.
```

Who Is This For?

This project is great for:

- Beginners who want to understand **how microservices work** in real projects.
- Junior Java Developers learning **Spring Boot and backend architecture**.
- Anyone preparing for **Java interviews** or building a **portfolio**.
- Curious minds who want to explore **Kafka, Redis, AWS S3, Eureka**, and more.

Itâ€™s a hands-on way to see how real systems are built and how services talk to each other.
